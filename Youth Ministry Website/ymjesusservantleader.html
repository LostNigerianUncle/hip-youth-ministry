<p class="articletext">Jesus will always be known for his leadership and care for others which is why most would call him a Servant Leader.</p>

<p class="articletext">Servant Leadership is the quality of leading while being in relationship with others, serving other people to help them grow as future Servant Leaders. Those who are considered Servant Leaders have the qualities of empathy, listening, persuasion, awareness, healing, and a commitment to the growth of others (Spears 2010).</p>

<p class="articletext">One of the most famous examples of Jesus being a Servant Leader is when Jesus washed his disciples’ feet. In Jesus’ time, washing feet was a job reserved for those who were less fortunate in society. Having a leader like Jesus wash his disciples’ feet was shocking for them, but Jesus always has a reason for his actions. In John 13:14-5, Jesus said,</p>

<p class="quote"><strong>“Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.”</strong></p>

<p class="articletext">Because Jesus is so willing to break the social hierarchy to help others, he is considered the ultimate Servant Leader and rightfully so. His purpose was to serve humankind and believed whoever wanted to achieve greatness should seek the role of a servant (Crowther 2008).</p>

<p class="articletext">Going back to Jesus washing his disciples’ feet, Jesus consolidated the concepts of leadership, servanthood, and greatness and he showed the full extent of his love to his disciples. This love Jesus showed to his disciples is known as ‘Agape love’. Derived from the Greek word, ‘Agape’ is the highest form of love being a selfless and unconditional love. Jesus showed Agape love for the last time on Earth when he died on the cross for the sins of the world (Zavada 2021).</p>

<p class="articletext">Jesus proved to his people that he is the example of Servant Leadership and those who are willing to put other’s needs before theirs should follow his example of humility and love (Colorado Christian University 2024).</p>
