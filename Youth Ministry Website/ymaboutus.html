<h5>About me</h5>

<section>
<p class="articletext">My name is <em>Mark Ivancic</em>. I am a Year 10 student of MSC school <em>Daramalan College</em> and the creator of <em>Hip Youth Ministry</em>.</p> 

<p class="articletext">My favourite hobbies are playing video games and reading books. Right now, I am reading Dune because I loved the movies and they are a lot better than Star Wars.</p>

<p class="articletext">My Father is of Croatian descent and Croatia has one of the highest Catholic percentages in the world. My mother was born in Cape Town, South Africa though her real heritage is likely in England and Ireland. Those three countries have a big catholic population but Ireland is the only country with a catholic majority.</p> 

<p class="articletext">I believe Youth Ministry is important because it reminds us of the significance of the Good News and the teachings of the Bible. There’s this one quote by 26th U.S President Theodore Roosevelt that reads,</p>

<p class="quote"><strong>“A thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education.”</strong></p> 

<p class="articletext">This quote always makes me think about how important it is to learn about the teachings of the Bible and the Youth Ministry can help me understand those teachings to grasp the <em>Good News</em>.</p>
