<p class="articletext">Imagine living in France in the mid-1800’s. The country has changed dramatically due to a revolution changing the entire social structure of the country. The church was associated with the rich and powerful and many considered them to be out of touch with the common people. French society was desperate for adequate solutions to social problems and having their physical, psychological, and spiritual needs met (Baker 1996).</p>

<p class="articletext">That’s when a priest named <em>Jules Chevalier</em> came in to form the <em>Missionaries of the Sacred Heart</em> to tell the people that Jesus greatly cares for those who are suffering, contrary to popular belief at the time. The MSC promotes the idea of Heart Spirituality which is the belief that God loves all people and we can share this love with other people. Heart Spirituality also reminds us of Jesus’ humanity for he was just as human as the rest of us but he had the power of God (Baker 1996). MSC missionary James Maher explains the importance of Heart Spirituality for everyone,</p> 

<p class="quote"><strong>“A Spirituality of the Heart is a way of living – a way of being in the world…a journey to be travelled (with others), …an energy that sustains and moves us, a dance in which we are participating… a way of being in the world, in relationship to self, others and God; a way of coming to rest within ourselves, at our deepest centre”</strong>(Baker 1996).</p>

<p class="articletext">It’s truly no wonder the MSC’s motto is ‘May the Sacred Heart of Jesus be everywhere loved’.</p>
