<p class="articletext">In this Hip Youth Ministry Vlog, we discuss the importance of setting goals for the future and what Jesus would say about our ambition. Everyone has to have a plan of what they want to do in the future, therefore it is important that we must come together and talk about our ambitions to understand how we can achieve them.</p>
